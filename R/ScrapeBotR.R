#' ScrapeBotR: Retrieve Data from a ScrapeBot Database
#'
#' ScrapeBotR allows to easily retrieve (large amounts of) data from a [ScrapeBot](https://github.com/MarHai/ScrapeBot) installation.
#' The package provides easy-to-use functions to read and export instances, recipes, runs, log information, and data.
#' Thereby, the package plugs neatly into the tidyverse as it makes heavy use of tibbles.

#' @section ScrapeBot:
#' The ScrapeBot (without "R") is a non-R tool for so-called "agent-based testing" to automatically visit, modify, and scrape a defined set of webpages regularly.
#' It was built to automate various web-based tasks and keep track of them in a controllable way for academic research, primarily in the realm of computational social science.
