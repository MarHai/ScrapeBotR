Title: Orchestrate Instances and Retrieve Data from a ScrapeBot Database
Version: 0.6.7
Authors@R:
    person(given = 'Mario', 
           family = 'Haim', 
           email = 'mario@haim.it', 
           role = c('aut', 'cre'))
Description: ScrapeBotR (with "R") allows to easily retrieve (large amounts of) data from a ScrapeBot installation.
    The package provides easy-to-use functions to read and export instances, recipes, runs, log information, and data. It also allows to bulk-download screenshots from S3. Thereby, the package plugs neatly into the tidyverse as it makes heavy use of tibbles.
    The ScrapeBot (without "R") is a tool for so-called "agent-based testing" to automatically visit, modify, and scrape a defined set of webpages regularly. It was built to automate various web-based tasks and keep track of them in a controllable way for academic research, primarily in the realm of computational social science.
